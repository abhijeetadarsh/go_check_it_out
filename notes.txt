A Github account with your own project will go further than a certificate.
The application can be pointless as well. It's just a learning experience at the end of the day. Github is free, and github actions is free for open source repositories.
It would be impressive to see
    an app that compiles
    has unit tests
    runs unit tests in ci
    has some sort of build system, like goreleaser.

This is a lot of work if you've not done in before, but will be much more impressive than a certificate and likely place you ahead of others who also have little to no experience.
Going further, and application that takes advantage of interfaces and channels will be more impressive. The goal is to show you understand how to do things in Go.
